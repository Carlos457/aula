            <h1>Disgaea: Hour of Darkness</h1>
            <h2>Quirky, stylistic, and overly challenging, Atlus' latest is a godsend for hardcore RPG fanatics</h2>
    
            <p>It's official: RPG enthusiasts are in heaven. Already inundated by a wave of new role-playing adventures in the first eight months of 2003 alone, it's been a great time for PS2 owners to love the genre. Xenosaga, Dark Cloud 2, dot-hack, and Arc the Lad are but a few of the titles we've seen this year already, and there's still plenty more on the way. Not to be outdone by big name companies like Square Enix and Sony, however, the moderately sized Japanese publisher Atlus Software has gotten into the mix as well. Best known for its Ogre Battle and Devil Summoner franchises, Atlus is looking to kick off a new mainstay with its new strategy/RPG experiment Disgaea: Hour of Darkness.</p>
            <p >Pronounced "Dis-Gay-Uh", Hour of Darkness is an uncanny amalgam of both traditional and unconventional RPG staples. Telling the tale of the self-absorbed Prince Laharl, Disgaea moves away from the typical "heroes of light" setting, and replaces it with a demon-infested netherworld. Awoken after a two-year slumber, Laharl is stunned to learn of his father King Krichevskoy's death and the massive civil war for the throne that has followed. The rightful heir and all-around egocentric bastard that he is, Laharl isn't about to lose his birthright without a fight, and it's from there the story really takes off. Happily, the gameplay follows suit.</p>
            <p>Never taking itself too seriously, Disgaea is packed with a distinctive brand of sarcastic evil. Borrowing the same isometric approach that the Ogre Battle and Final Fantasy Tactics games have enjoyed over the years, Disgaea isn't aimed at the novice RPG crowd in the least. But rather, it's blatantly targeted towards the increasingly upward and dedicated sect of strategy and RPG gamers. As a result, the multitude of menus, items types, weapon categories, and other such factors may seem a bit intimidating to the laymen. But that's okay -- it's one of the game's most persuasive strengths and we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            
            <p>At its heart, Disgaea is made up of two main types of experiences: Planning and Battle. Instead of leaving the player to their own devices on a menu screen, however, Disgaea's planning phase is set up in a similar fashion to that of a small town. Able to access stores, training facilities, and other such areas in a completely investigative mini-hub, the feeling that you're in an interactive community rather than a placeholder between skirmishes is a nice change of pace.</p>
            <p>But developer Nippon Ichi has taken it a step further -- and given just about everything in Hour of Darkness some kind of important affect on the gameplay. The merchant system, for instance, works just like a character. With an experience level that rises as you buy more expensive and useful items. As your product and customer ranks continue to raise, the kinds of equipment, prices, and availability becomes more and more beneficial. So while you could definitely trek through the game without exploring this option too much, dedicated players are rewarded for using the tools available.</p>
            <p>Of course, the depth doesn't stop there -- as gamers can also access an ingenious class-creation system to bolster their party. Dubbed the "Dark Assembly", players will be able to create customized characters and propose new elements that change the options available to them. The whole thing is set up like a senatorial congregation (just as the name implies), and actually requires you to use your influence to get your proposals to pass. Gaining favor with senators can be reached through an assortment of different methods as well and lends itself to just about anyone's gaming style.</p>
            <p>Gaining a high rank through training, winning conflicts on the battlefield, giving out gifts, and even forcing the senators to see it your way via the tip of your sword are all viable options. But the latter won't guarantee you a victory, as the senators you defeat in battle will only return during the next assembly with more animosity towards you (making your follow-up proposal even more difficult to pass). The proposals themselves can range from something basic (selling cheaper or more expensive items at the storefront) to the more advanced (increase a character's counter-attack ratio, new classes). So depending on how far you want to take your game, the windows are wide open.</p>
            <p>Back to the character creation system, Disgaea offers players over 120 different types of heroes. Humanoid and monster alike, each class has its own strengths and weaknesses, potential, and special abilities. To create them, you have to go through your buddies at the Dark Assembly (though some can be made without needing permission), and their value and ability is all dependant on the Assembly rank of your host character and the Mana points available. As you continue to beat new classes and monsters, they become cheaper to make as well, so fighting often and in different locations can help make your options a whole lot brighter.</p>
            <p>This whole process is known as the "Mentor/Pupil" relationship, and as your created character raises in levels, so too does your main inventor. It's a symbiotic affiliation that eventually opens up additional units and abilities, and makes everyone generally more powerful. Though the upgrades won't stop there. If a character reaches the top of their class's potential (or if you just feel like making a change), you can approach the Assembly with a Transmigration offer. This offer busts down a character to level 1 status in a different class, with all new abilities and skills. Of course, they'll start out as a more powerful than a typical level 1 and even carry over some of their previous stats and abilities. It's truly the ultimate upgrade system and with over 120 different classes to choose from, can practically be repeated forever.</p>

            <p>Once you've created the party you want, it's off to the second mechanic of Disgaea's existence: the combat. Set up in the familiar strategy/ RPG vein, the isometric battles are easy to understand and complicated to master. Entirely turn-based, players are always given the initiative and allowed to plot their moves before the enemy. And once they've landed where they need to go, it's the other side's turn and the battle ensues from there. Simple as it may sound, it's actually a whole lot tougher than it looks.</p>
            <p>For starters, the enemy A.I. can get quite brutal in even the earliest of stages (though most units still follow the same "wait until they're close enough before I move" pattern that was established in Shining Force all those years ago). And depending on the terrain and types of enemies you're faced with can turn into quite a little brain game. Geo Symbols, for instance, are pyramid-shaped power-ups that grant special abilities to any unit standing one of its affected tiles (invincibility, increased strength, decreased hit points, etc), and knowing how to use these to your advantage can often mean the difference between life and death. Once you're good enough at learning how and when to properly destroy a Geo Symbol, it can produce combination chains that can score as many as 7,000 hits (and higher) all across the map.</p>
            <p>Speaking of combinations, character alignment can create specialized attacks of their own. If one, two, or even four friendly units are all lined up in adjacent squares, there's a chance that it will activate a special combo that allows everyone to hit its target without using its movement points. Of course, the same rule applies to your opponents as well, and when taking into consideration the elevation of your tiles, direction a unit is facing, and the Geo Symbol factors that influence your area, there's a whole lot of thinking and strategizing that takes place.</p>
            <p>If there's one hindrance that really hurts Hour of Darkness, though, it's the unresponsive and not-so useful camera. Limited in how it navigates, where it can go, and how easily it's obstructed, the viewpoint often makes it difficult to tell what's going on or where your unit is standing. As a result, it's also sometimes problematic to properly aim your long-range weapons and attacks without having to go back and re-aim multiple times. These little snags aren't the end of the world, but it did grow bothersome on more than a few occasions.</p>
            
            <h3>Graphics</h3>
            
            <p>The animation in Disgaea isn't going to win any awards. And to be truthful we've seen equal, if not superior, fluidity in late-generation PlayStation One games. Details for the characters and backgrounds aren't that impressive either, and the isometric camera causes major problems in populated battles (as highlighted above).</p>
            <p>What it truly made us realize is that Hour of Darkness needs an up and down option to accompany the spinning player-controlled perspective. Because unfortunately there were far too many occasions that saw combat cinematics or elaborate spell animations completely obscured by some kind of random obstacle. Konami's old Vandal Hearts series always did a good job of handling this issue with its dynamic camera system that enabled the player to adjust the view in practically any configuration. It would have done the folks at Nippon Ichi some good to follow this example.</p>
            <p>But for what Disgaea lacks in technical luster, however, it more than makes up it for in terms of artistic style. Heavily Japanese, 2D, and almost as colorful as Square Enix's UNLIMITED SaGa, Hour of Darkness practically oozes personality. The expressive Manga-based illustrations that progress the storyline and wacky characters and monsters are ripped right out of the 8 and 16-bit eras too; making old RPG diehards like ourselves aflutter with just a hint of nostalgia. Also worth mentioning are the old-school combinations and spell cinematics -- they're just as basic as the rest of the game's presentation sure, but we'd be lying if we didn't acknowledge how cool they are.</p>

            <h3>Sound</h3>
            
            <p>As any great RPG should, Disgaea offers a wide range of dissimilar musical compositions that explores both the whimsical and sullen side of emotion. Unlike the majority of today's mainstream role-players, however, Hour of Darkness almost completely avoids the sweeping orchestral approach found in Final Fantasy and Xenosaga, and shoots instead for something entirely different.</p>
            <p>Here the composer has opted for a bizarre mixture of cyndrilical inspiration taken right out of your grandmother's music box, and combined it with some upbeat Spanish Tango and King of Fighters-style jazz. Using the former technique for moments of strife and seriousness and the latter for just about everything else, the game's distinct brand of audio levity may not be what you're used to, but it's still pretty good. In fact, there are even a couple of times where it borders on really good.</p>
            <p>Vocally the game's acoustics reveal the storyline's true nature -- with professional voice actors playing their parts with an obvious flippancy. Typically, the dialogue is overflowing with biting sarcasm, ham-handed cheesiness, and grade school-type simplicity, but there are a few moments of legitimate "acting" here and there. For the most part, though, Disgaea is extremely lighthearted and far less "self-important" as most other RPGs. Though audiophiles may want to take note: your options are only limited to basic mono and stereo.</p>
           
            <h3>Verdict</h3>
           
            <p>Despite the 2000-plus words already dedicated to Hour of Darkness, there's still a lot of ground to be covered. We never got around to the fact that characters can be built up all the way to level 10,000; and never had the chance to tell you that you can actually travel inside any item or weapon to defeat its inhabitants for an increase in that relic's power. We got to mention that you're actually rewarded for taking damage by your team doctor via treasure bonuses, and never gained the opportunity to inform you that there's an innumerous amount of hidden classes and special endings.</p>
            <p>But that's what's so great about Disgaea: Regardless of how many hours you put into its 13 episodes, how often you upgrade your characters, or how relentlessly you equip your team members, there's always something new to discover. And with the added bonus of a "New Game +" feature, you can continuously explore the alternate paths you didn't have the chance to check out the first time, or go back and whip a boss that gave you too much trouble initially.</p>
            <p>The most amazing thing about Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, though, is just how incredibly fun it is. Humorous, entertaining, and different from just about anything else in its category, we aren't afraid to say that it's one of the best PlayStation 2 titles this year. Though it certainly won't appeal to everyone because of its hardcore nature and admittedly retro visuals, fans of the genre have just hit the mother lode. But don't take our word for it, as you'd do better to run out and play it. A special game like this comes few and far between.</p>
